#Movie Analysis
##[Problem Statement]

Develop a pseudo frontend web app for Movie Analysis.

 

###Tasks

**Basic:**

* — Use of web API to fetch movie details.

* — Implement a grid on the UI, listing all the movie details.

* — Implement pagination on the UI. Show only 10 records at a time and allow users to go back and forth.

 

**Advanced:**

* — Grid columns should provide sort and filter like excel sheet. Columns [genres, language, country, budget, title_year] should provide sort and filter.

* — Dark - Light theme. Implement a Dark - Light theme in your web app and allow users to toggle between them.

* — The filtering should be implemented for each individual column, and as someone types or chooses from a dropdown, the table or grid below dynamically shows the matching records.

* — If time permits, use your creativity and implement features which would make your web app user friendly.
